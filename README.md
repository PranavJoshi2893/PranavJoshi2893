### About Me

#### SQL Data Modeling
I specialize in SQL data modeling, focusing on relation mapping to ensure efficient database design. This involves defining relationships between various data entities, optimizing database schemas for performance, and ensuring data integrity. My approach includes:

- **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs):** Creating visual representations of database structures.
- **Normalization:** Structuring databases to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
- **Optimized Query Performance:** Writing efficient SQL queries and indexing strategies.

#### Express.js Development
In my Express.js projects, I emphasize maintaining a clean and scalable codebase, incorporating best practices for security, and implementing robust authentication mechanisms. My key practices include:

1. **Scalable Folder Structure:**
   - Organizing code into distinct folders for routes, controllers, models, middlewares, and services.
   - Adopting a modular approach to simplify maintenance and enhance scalability.

2. **Whitelist Usage:**
   - Implementing whitelists for query parameters, request bodies, and other inputs to prevent unauthorized access and ensure only expected data is processed.
   - Using libraries like `express-validator` to enforce input validation and sanitation.

3. **Data Validation and Sanitization:**
   - Ensuring all incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other security vulnerabilities.
   - Employing middleware for centralized validation logic, improving code maintainability.

4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
   - Implementing RBAC using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to manage user permissions and restrict access to specific resources based on user roles.
   - Creating middleware to check user roles and permissions dynamically, ensuring secure and controlled access.

5. **Access and Refresh Tokens:**
   - Implementing access tokens for secure API authentication and authorization.
   - Using refresh tokens to maintain user sessions securely, enabling seamless user experiences without compromising security.

6. **Async Operations:**
   - Implementing asynchronous operations using promises and async/await to enhance performance and user experience.
   - Ensuring efficient handling of I/O operations, such as database queries and API calls, without blocking the main execution thread.

#### Frontend Development with Angular
In addition to backend development, I am proficient in frontend development using Angular. I focus on creating dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. My key practices include:

1. **Component-Based Architecture:**
   - Building reusable components to maintain consistency and simplify the development process.
   - Ensuring components are modular and easy to maintain.

2. **State Management:**
   - Implementing state management solutions like NgRx to manage application state efficiently.
   - Ensuring state is predictable and easily traceable.

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - Utilizing CSS frameworks and Angular Material to create responsive designs that work seamlessly across different devices.
   - Ensuring a consistent user experience on both desktop and mobile platforms.

4. **Form Management:**
   - Using Angular's powerful form handling capabilities to create complex forms with validation and dynamic controls.
   - Ensuring data integrity and user input validation.

5. **API Integration:**
   - Integrating with backend services using Angular's HttpClient module.
   - Ensuring secure and efficient communication between frontend and backend.

6. **Async Operations:**
   - Implementing async operations in Angular using RxJS observables to handle asynchronous data streams.
   - Ensuring smooth and responsive user interactions by managing asynchronous events efficiently.

#### Personal Interests and Goals
My journey in web development is driven by a passion for creating efficient, secure, and scalable applications. I admire the pioneering work of figures like Margaret Hamilton, Grace Hopper, and Ada Lovelace, and strive to follow in their footsteps by contributing to the field with innovative solutions and best practices.

I am also interested in backend development and enjoy connecting with like-minded professionals to share knowledge and collaborate on exciting projects.
